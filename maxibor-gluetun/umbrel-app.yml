  Gluetun is a lightweight VPN client written in Go that supports multiple VPN providers
  including ProtonVPN, Windscribe etc. It acts as a VPN gateway for other Docker containers, allowing
  them to route their traffic through the VPN connection.
  
  
  This setup is pre-configured for ProtonVPN Wireguard but supports many other providers. Other
  containers can route their traffic through Gluetun by using its network stack.
  
  
  Key features:
    - Support for multiple VPN providers (Windscribe, NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc.)
    - Built-in firewall with kill switch
    - DNS over TLS (DoT) support
    - HTTP proxy server
    - Health monitoring and automatic reconnection
    - Port forwarding support (provider dependent)
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
    Before installing, make sure you have your ProtonVPN credentials ready. (Because i use protonvpn ;-) )
    You'll need to add the PROTONVPN_PRIVATE_KEY in the exports.sh file.
    !! Also if you want port forwarding, choose the private key belonging to the portforwarding setup in the protonvpn configurator

    ⚠️ NOTE: Please ssh into your umbrel or via the settings icon -> Advanced settings -> Terminal (open) to change the exports file.
